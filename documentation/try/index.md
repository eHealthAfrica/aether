# Try Aether For Yourself

Aether is a platform. This means that it doesn’t do much on its own: it only makes sense to use it in the context of creating a solution. For this initial run-through, we’re going to create a simple solution that takes data collected in a microcensus and feeds it out to dashboards. We’ll start with some raw json input data, and create some mappings to transform it into a more useable state. 

In the next step, we'll see how that data can then be fed through to CKAN by using Aether Connect, but first things first...

We’ve created an `aether-bootstrap` repository to make it easy for you to get up and running with your first Aether-based solution. This contains a bunch of `docker-compose` files that will pull Docker images of the latest version of Aether from Docker Hub and start them up. 

## Prerequisites

Since Aether is a development platform, these instructions assume that you are a Developer or DevOps type person with familiarity with the commandline, github and docker. There isn't any programming required but the instructions will be challenging if you are not used to scripts, config files, JSON and just generally performing system admin type tasks.  If this is not you, Gather may be more apropriate.
[You can try Gather here](https://gather.ehealthafrica.org/documentation/try/).

You will need a computer running Linux, Mac OSX or a cloud based Linux VM (such as AWS) with 8MB of RAM. These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.x (we have seen issues with 14.x VMs) and Mac 10.13.x

- GitHub
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed and available
- Docker
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed setup with at least 3GB limit
- The following ports should be available on your machine:  
80, 8000, 8004, 8443

You will also need to register some domains for local resolution on your computer. This means editing your hosts file. On Mac/Linux this is at `/etc/hosts`; Modify the line that starts with `127.0.0.1` to include:

```
127.0.0.1       ui.aether.local kernel.aether.local
```

## Into the Aether

The easiest way to start building an Aether-based solution is to use _Aether Bootstrap_. Begin by cloning this repository to your computer:

```
git clone git@github.com:eHealthAfrica/aether-bootstrap.git
cd aether-bootstrap
```

If you are starting Aether for the first time, you will need to create some docker resources (networks and volumes) and generate credentials for all applications:

```
./scripts/initialise_docker_environment.sh
```

Now you just need to tell Docker to download the images and start them up:

```
docker-compose up
```

Once the console output has stopped, you should be able to access the Aether UI in your browser. Use these credentials to log in:
```
http://ui.aether.local/
```
- _Username:_ **admin**
- _Password:_ **adminadmin**

If you see this screen, you are all configured and ready to move on.

Now let’s [start creating our first Aether-based solution](walkthrough-core).
