# Set up AWS EC2 Instances for evaluating Aether and Gather

Starting up an AWS instance and configuring it for use with the Aether and Gather is very easy once you have an AWS account.  If you are totally new to AWS and would like to try it out, start with the [Amazon EC2 Users Guide for Linux Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html) and then follow the instructions below.

This guide will take you through the steps required to create and configure an EC2 instance that can be used to evaluate and use Gather and Aether in a **Non Production** environment.  This guide doesn't setup strong security and does not provide any data backup or protection.  **When the EC2 instance terminates, all of your data will be lost.**

## Overview of the setup process

If you are already comfortable with configuring and running Amazon EC2 instances, just follow this list of steps and return to [Try Gather](http://gather.ehealthafrica.org/documentation/try/setup) or [Try Aether](index#into-the-aether)

* Create an EC2 Ubuntu instance with at least 2 processors, 8GB RAM and 8GB Storage **t2.large**
* Configure your VPC to be accessible from the internet with the following ports open . _For demo purposes, it's okay to open all the ones below if you are not sure which ones you will need:_
  * 22 - ssh for setup and configuration. Always required.
  * 80 - http for UI. Always required.
  * 8000 - For submitting data to the Aether REST API.
  * 8443 - ODK port for submitting surveys from ODK Collect to Gather.
  * 5000 - Demo CKAN Portal where Aether/Gather can send data.
  * 5601 - Demo Kibana instance to analyze data sent from Aether/Gather to Elasticsearch
* Verify/Install git, Docker and Docker Compose. It helps if Docker can be [run as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
* Use _Stop_ instead of _Terminate_ if you want to preserve data between sessions.

## Very detailed steps for people new to AWS

[ ![AWS EC2 Launch](/images/aws-ec2-launch.png)](/images/aws-ec2-launch.png){: .scalable}Log into your Amazon Web Services account and navigate to the EC2 Management Console.  Select an availability zone appropriate to your location. The screenshot shows that my zone is set to Frankfurt.

Click **Launch Image** to create a new EC2 image.

[![AWS EC2 AMI](/images/aws-ec2-step1.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step1.png){: .scalable}**Step 1: Choose an AMI -** Select **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type** from the list of AMIs

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Instance Type](/images/aws-ec2-step2.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step2.png){: .scalable}**Step 2: Choose an Instance Type -** Select **t2.large** with 2 CPUs and 8 GB RAM

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Instance Details](/images/aws-ec2-step3.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step3.png){: .scalable}**Step 3: Configure Instance Details -** Accept all the defaults except for **Auto-assign Public IP** which should be set to **Enable**

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Add Storage](/images/aws-ec2-step4.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step4.png){: .scalable}**Step 4: Add Storage -** The defaults should be fine for just the demo.  If you plan to test with lots of other data, then increase **Size (GiB) -** from 8 GiB to something more appropriate for your use case

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Add Tags](/images/aws-ec2-step5.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step5.png){: .scalable}**Step 5: Add Tags -** No tags are required

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Ports](/images/aws-ec2-step6.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step6.png){: .scalable}**Step 6: Configure Security Group -** Open up the the following ports so that you can access them from your local computer. Ports 22, 80, 8000, 8443, 5000 and 5601. _Note: The screenshot is missing port 5601_

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Ports](/images/aws-ec2-step7-sm.png)](/images/aws-ec2-step7.png){: .scalable}**Step 7: Review Instance Launch -** Verify your launch settings with the screenshot on the left. When you feel good about your settings, press **Launch**.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Key Pair](/images/aws-ec2-KeyPair.png)](/images/aws-ec2-KeyPair.png){: .scalable}**Select your key pair -** Amazon EC2 uses public–key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. In order for you to log in to your instance, you must have an [Amazon EC2 cryptographic key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) specified for your instance and stored locally on your client machine.  If you already have a key pair that you use for AWS, select it here and go to the next step. The rest of this guide will refer to the name as "Test_Keys.pem."

If you don't have a key pair, select **Create a new key pair**, give it a name and press **Download Key Pair**.  The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is .pem. Save the private key file in a safe place.  I use .ssh in my home folder. If you will use an SSH client on a Mac or Linux computer to connect to your instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

```bash
chmod 400 Test_Keys.pem
```

[![AWS EC2 Wait](/images/aws-ec2-console.png)](/images/aws-ec2-console.png){: .scalable}**Wait for instance to be ready -** It will take a few minutes for your instance to initialize and be ready for service.  Bring up your EC2 console and wait for the **Status Checks** to be complete and for **Instance State** to change to **running**.  You will need to note the **IPv4 Public IP Address** displayed on the console.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Connect Info](/images/aws-ec2-connect.png)](/images/aws-ec2-connect.png){: .scalable}**Connection info -** After your instance is ready, select it in your EC2 console and press the **Actions** button.  In the drop down, select **Connect** and you will be presented with a popup that has all the connect info for your instance.  You will use this info at the commandline in order to connect to your instance via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Connect](/images/aws-ec2-ssh.png)](/images/aws-ec2-ssh.png){: .scalable}**Connect to your instance -** Bring up a command line and enter the following command where **~/.ssh/Test_Keys.pem** is replaced by the location of your .pem file and **18.184.160.216** is replaced by the IP address of your instance.  If you are questioned about the authenticity of the host, answer **yes**.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

```bash
ssh -i "~/.ssh/Test_Keys.pem" ubuntu@18.184.160.216
```

If you successfully logged into your Ubuntu EC2 instance, congratulations, the hard part is over and you can move to the next steps.  If you were not able to login to your instance, here are a few things to look at based on your error message:

* **Permissions 0644 for '~/.ssh/Test_Keys.pem' are too open.** - You did not successfully change permission for your .pem file.  Follow the instructions in **Select your key pair** step from above
* **ssh: connect to host 18.197.111.229 port 22: Operation timed out** - Your instance is either not running or your VPC is not properly configured with port 22 open.  Verify that your instance is ready by following the **Wait for instance to be ready** step above.  Also, verify that you have followed **Step 6: Configure Security Group** exactly.  If you have an older AWS account, it is possible that your default VPC has been deleted and the one used above is not configured with a properly permissioned default gateway.  This article explains the situation and the solution: [Default VPC and Default Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html)

## Installing Docker and Docker Compose

At this point you should have a brand new Amazon EC2 Ubuntu Instance and are able to connect via secure shell.  The last preparation step is to install Docker and Docker Compose.  These steps will perform the installation but if you want more information about what you are installing, see the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) install pages on the Docker web site.

If you are not already logged into your instance, follow the **Connect to your instance** steps above.

[![AWS EC2 APT Update](/images/aws-ec2-docker1.png)](/images/aws-ec2-docker1.png){: .scalable}**Update package tool (apt) -** Update the _apt_ package index and verify that the necessary tools are installed on the system.  Add Docker’s official GPG key and setup the latest stable Docker repository. Finally, update the package index again for Docker.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

sudo apt-get update
```

<p style="clear: both;"/>

[![AWS EC2 Docker](/images/aws-ec2-docker2.png)](/images/aws-ec2-docker2.png){: .scalable}**Install Docker -** Execute the **apt-get** command below and answer **Y** when prompted to continue.

By default, the docker install does not add any users to the docker group.  This requires you to prepend all docker commands with **sudo** in order to have permission to execute them.  You can optionally run the **usermod** command below to add the **ubuntu** user to the docker group and not have to use **sudo**. For more information about the security implications of this, see [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall).

<p style="clear: both;"/>

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

_After the usermod command, you will have to `exit` and then re-login to your instance._

[![AWS EC2 Docker Compose](/images/aws-ec2-docker3.png)](/images/aws-ec2-docker3.png){: .scalable}**Install Docker Compose -** Get latest Docker Compose.  At the time of this writing, the latest version was 1.22.0.  Over time, you may want to [check the latest version](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) and change **1.22.0** to that version.  After installing Docker Compose, verify that both it and Docker works.

<p style="clear: both;"/>

```bash
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version

docker run hello-world
```

_If you had a permission error running Docker's "Hello World" then you didn't run the **usermod** statement from above or you didn't exit and log back in.  Otherwise, you will have to prepend **sudo** to all docker commands._

Congratulations!!! Your environment should now be set up to try Aether or Gather.
