# Aether Setup and Deployment

Every Aether component has an associated [Helm](https://helm.sh/) file, to enable deployment via [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to your infrastructure of choice. 

You can also use these helm files to create a local installation on your computer using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), but you might find it easier to just use [Docker](https://docker.com/) instead. For instructions on how to do a local installation with Docker, take a look [here](/documentation/try/).
