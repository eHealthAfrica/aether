            Be sure to use the full name of the type. For example if you're working with
            the Schema.org library and want a person, use 'http://schema.org/Person'. The depth
            attribute controls how many connected schema are pulled for each request. For example
            if each person has a home of linked type House, with depth=0 a request for person would
            also get the definition for house. Extending the example a house might have an address
            with type Location. A request for type Person with depth=1 would return definitions for
            Person, House, and Location. You can always remove linked types after you've built your
            request."
