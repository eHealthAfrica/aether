Create a readonly user in the kernel database.

Background: aether producers can query the kernel database via psycopg2,
bypassing the safety checks django provides. They only need read permissions
and should therefore use a readonly user.

This script is intended to run in the `setup_db` block of `entrypoint.sh`, with
access to all environment variables available in that context.
'''

import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import sql

# Create a readonly user with username "{role}" if none exists.
# Grant read permission for relevant tables.
