  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image"><img src="images/challenge1.svg" alt="Challenge Interoperability"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Interoperability</h5>
      <p>Effective health interventions require medical data to be fast and easily shared between health organizations and their partners. However, their Information Management Systems (IMS) usually do not speak the same language, making the data exchange process slower and expensive. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image"><img src="images/challenge2.svg" alt="Challenge Security"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Security and Privacy</h5>
      <p>Data Privacy and Security are particularly important when handling personally identifiable health records. Despite the established right to health data protection, it sometimes falls second to other programmatic or analytical goals in order to accelerate the access to data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-image"><img src="images/challenge3.svg" alt="Challenge Data Workflow"></img></div>
      <h5 class="block__title">Lack of Data Workflow Processes</h5>
      <p>A lack of effective processes for creating, modifying, and releasing health data is  delaying the availability of accurate, up-to-date information. This hinders the decision-making process and impacts public health services delivery.</p>

  <div class="box-image center">  <img src="images/gather2.png" alt="Gather – data collection tool"></img></div>
  <h3 class="section__subtitle">Gather - a versatile data collection and curation tool built on top of Aether. Gather enables people to securely collect data in the field and quickly share it anywhere where it is needed.</h3>
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="block">
      <h5 class="block__title">The Challenge</h5>
      <p>Oftentimes different data collected in the field need to be aggregated and transformed through workflow processes before being published. Most of the existing data collection tools, however, do not support the data interoperability and curation needed to perform these tasks and have to go through the expensive process of exporting and restructuring data before publishing them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <h5 class="block__title">The Solution</h5>
      <p>Being built on Aether, Gather can interoperate differently structured data collected in the field, integrate them with other systems and workflows for data management, transformation and analysis, and securely deploy them using cloud environments or on-premises deployments. </p>

    <div class="block">
      <h5 class="block__title">The Impact</h5>
      <p>Developed in 2015 for a nutrition project in Somalia, Gather is currently in use on a number of different projects in several countries, and has already collected data from hundreds of thousands of submissions. Here are a few projects for which Gather2 was used:</p>
